# Creative Coding for Interactive Art

Currently in the process of transition from google slides.

## Fundamentals

*Building up a set of skills and tools to start a creative coding practice.*

## Interactive programming

*Prototyping interactive systems with dataflow languages and in Unity. The focus is on nimble, experimental iteration.*
