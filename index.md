# Creative Coding for Interactive Art

Lecture notes and [[resources]] for the creative coding and interactive music courses [I](//rvirmoors.github.io) teach
at the [ITPMA M.A.](//cinetic.arts.ro/en/itpma/) @UNATC. <br/>
Work-in-progress, transitioning from google slides & assorted notebooks.

## Fundamentals

*Building up a set of skills and tools to start a creative coding practice.*
<br/><br/>

| **Processing & p5js** | | | **Extensions** | |                        | **Python** | |            
| :-------- | -------- |--- | :-------- | -------- | --- | :-------- | -------- | 
| [[Intro to CCIA]]     |  |    | Visualization     |  |                    | Practical Python  |  [slides](slides/01-12-practical-python) | 
| Basics     | |            | Node.js and APIs     |  |                 | More Python       |  [slides](slides/01-13-more-python) |
| Algorithms     | |        | OSC and HCI     |  |
| Loops     | |             | Advanced OOP     |  |
| Functions     | |
| Objects     | |
| Arrays     | |

## Real-time systems

*Prototyping interactive systems with dataflow languages and Unity. The focus is on nimble, experimental iteration.*

| [[Intro to Max & Pd and Unity]] | [slides](slides/02-01-max-unity-intro) | | [[From Processing to Unity]]     |  [slides](slides/02-02-p5-to-unity) |
| Control   |  |                    | OSC and APIs in Unity    |  |  
| Generation & sequencing   |  |    | Sound in Unity     |  |  
| OSC and Node in Max    |  |       | Procedural audio basics     |  |  
| Jitter & TouchDesigner basics    |  |
