# Creative Coding for Interactive Art

Lecture notes and [[resources]] for the creative coding and interactive music courses [I](//rvirmoors.github.io) teach
at the [ITPMA M.A.](//cinetic.arts.ro/en/itpma/) @UNATC. <br/>
Work-in-progress, transitioning from google slides & assorted notebooks. What's it all about? Read the [[manifesto]].

## Fundamentals

*Building up a set of skills and tools to start your creative coding practice.*
