# Project Description

My name is Grigore Burloiu and I teach at the [National University of Theatre and Film](https://www.unatc.ro/eng/about/index.php), in the [Interactive Technologies](https://youtu.be/o3TwqY9KJpQ) and [Art of Game Design](https://youtu.be/YpO7Ia8d8RQ) M.A. programmes. I'm applying for a Teaching Fellowship to create a practice-oriented syllabus of creative coding prerequisites for aspiring digital artists.

{% newthought 'I have been using Processing and p5.js' %}  to teach creative coding since 2017 (and other software, such as MaxMSP, since 2013). Our students come from various undergraduate backgrounds, such as arts, design, architecture, music, or engineering. In my experience, the main struggle people have when getting into creative coding isn't to do with creativity or coding (P5 is great as putting joy into learning to code) -- it's the gaps related to basic technical concepts, specifically: **data** (types, structures), **vectors** (linear algebra, differentiation), and **signals** (DSP).

Students are usually quick to grasp coding techniques and create what's on their mind, provided they have a working understanding of these building blocks. When someone is struggling with e.g. the screen coordinate system, learning about for loops at the same time can be a bit rough.{% sidenote 'challenge' '(naturally, it depends on the person and situation: sometimes, exactly this kind of double challenge leads to rewarding revelations)'%} Of course I'm not the first to bring up these issues: they are addressed in places such as the Processing handbook and The Nature of Code, or the [Math for Game Devs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLImQaTpSAdsD88wprTConznD1OY1EfK_V) and other online classes, but people just getting started might benefit from a systematic and open-source fundamental reference.

{% newthought 'To this end, I propose' %} to assemble a syllabus covering the basics of data structures, linear algebra and digital signals, to the extent that they're involved in standard creative coding practice. This will include linking to existing materials and writing additional content, plus creating mini-demonstrations of the principles in action using p5.js. 

Existing resources are either meant for people who've already started to code (like the ones I mentioned above) or for general audiences (without a clear indication of what's applicable to our field). This is the main difference of my approach: to impart abilities and intuition that enable a creative coding practice, without assuming any programming experience. Students wouldn't have to understand the code behind the p5.js demos, but they'd get the math involved, and know that later on in their journey they can return to the source and deepen their understanding.
