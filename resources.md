## Coding

[Learn to code](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/getting-started/learn-to/code/) tutorial. Game engine-based, but the principles apply to any creative coding.

For a more systematic intro to programming, try the [CS50 online course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) from Harvard, or the [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) book.

[Books and videos](https://shiffman.net/) by the indefatigable Daniel Shiffman, an essential resource.

Creative coding intros, using JavaScript, p5 etc: [Allison Parrish](https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/), [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/a2z/), [Jared Donovan](https://awarua.github.io/creative-coding/tutorials/tut13/index.html)

[Practical Python](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python) course by David Beazley.

[Preparation Course for Python](https://github.com/meinardmueller/PCP) by Meinard Müller et al. A solid introduction to programming via Python, notebooks, and towards numbers and [[signals](#signals)].

[Collision Detection](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/) introductory book by Jeff Thompson, with Processing implementations. See also the resulting [p5.js library](https://github.com/bmoren/p5.collide2D).

## Graphics

[Programming Design Systems](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/) book by Rune Madsen, on the foundations of code-based graphic design.

## Audio

[Free Audio Resources](https://www.freeaudioresource.com/), game-oriented but generally useful

[Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/) interactive tutorial @ Ableton

[An Introduction to Creative Artificial Intelligence for Music](https://kivanctatar.com/An-Introduction-to-Creative-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Music) by Kıvanç Tatar, a quick tour of the world of (musical) metacreation.

## Signals

[Seeing circles, sines and signals](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/) by Jack Schaedler, a visual introduction to digital signal processing.

[Learning resources](https://learn.flucoma.org/) @ FluCoMa, geared towards sound anaylsis, decomposition, recombination.

## Student work

[Plagiarism](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/academic-skills/academic-integrity/plagiarism) -- know what it is, and how to avoid it. Whenever in doubt, ask your prof.

[How to present a student software project](https://charlesmartin.com.au/blog/2020/08/09/student-project-repository) guide by Charles Martin. See also the resources on Git et al [below](#useful-tools).

# Useful tools
