# Manifesto<!-- omit in toc -->

Work in progress: a list of randomly assembled thoughts about what this material is about, how I teach it and how you might approach it.

(most of this is also things I tell myself on a regular basis...)

1. [The good stuff comes after.](#the-good-stuff-comes-after)
2. [You're here to have fun.](#youre-here-to-have-fun)
3. [Look for alternative perspectives.](#look-for-alternative-perspectives)

# The good stuff comes after.

{% newthought 'We donâ€™t start out' %} creating amazing work--that's for you to take the time and make on your own. My aim is to show you the tools and help you build an intuition of what they can do and where they may take you.

There's a great course (which someday I'll find the time to complete) called Drawabox which sets a [50% rule](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/2/50percent): half the time you complete dry technical exercises, and the other half you create. This idea seems very healthy to me: you acquire new skills easier when you can just focus on the process and not worry about the artistic value of the result. But then you need to keep the creative force alive that made you want to get into this field, which means going off on your own and spending time building stuff.

Let's count ourselves lucky. Most other things you've had to learn haven't been this fun. We get to see and hear things take shape and react to what we do! And you can take these things and their behaviours, pull them apart and make them your own.

# You're here to have fun.

{% newthought 'There is joy in learning these tools, and there is beauty.' %} If you're not having a good time with a part of the material, you shouldn't force it. Try using the skills you already have to build something, or just switch to something else.

Your learning journey is valuable in itself. Take the time to appreciate how far you've come. But again, this value gets lost if you don't apply yourself to some actual projects. Of course, that includes collaboration and dissemination: it can feel intimidating to put yourself out there, but a lot of good can come out of it. Anyway  it's all ones and zeros after all, so don't take it too seriously.

# Look for alternative perspectives.

I've come across this advice in many places, most notably for me [Gene Kogan's course @ ITP](https://ml4a.github.io/classes/itp-F18/) (which is one great source to learn about ML for art): try to approach learning new things from many different angles.
